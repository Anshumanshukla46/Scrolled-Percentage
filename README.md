# Scrolled-Percentage
This is feature which can be used in website where it describes how much content we have read/scrolled till now.

This feature is made using HTML,CSS,JS where HTML, CSS is just to add some content over which I can check the functionality but 
JAVASCRIPT part is most important which consist of main usage.

Here, I have used offsetHeight, clientHeight, scrollHeight like attribute to get the actual point till where I have reached then called a function of setScrolled
to show the result in upper right side.
